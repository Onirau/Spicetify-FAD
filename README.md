# Installation Instructions

First of all, I wouldn't recommend using this extension unless you're ok with occasional bugs, and alot of missing features from other FAD implementations.

Despite that, I would recommend installing the wrapper and that's it; you'll have automatic updates.

(Automatic)

```Run the AutoInstall-Wrapper.ps1```

OR

Run the following in Powershell.
```iex (iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onirau/Spicetify-FAD/main/AutoInstall-Wrapper.ps1 -UseBasicP)```

(Manually)

Drag and drop the wrapper into your Spiectify extensions folder and do the following commands.

```
spicetify config extensions wrapperFullscreen.js
spicetify apply
```
