# Installation Instructions

First of all, I wouldn't recommend using this extension unless you're ok with occasional bugs, and alot of missing features from other FAD implementations.

Despite that, I would recommend installing the wrapper and that's it; you'll have automatic updates.

Drag and drop the wrapper into your Spiectify extensions folder and do the following commands.

```
spicetify config extensions wrapperFullscreen.js
spicetify apply
```
